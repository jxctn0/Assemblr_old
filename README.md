_The Assemblr Emulator is a game designed to teach people the fundamentals of Assembly Language programming. It provides a platform for users to learn and practice Assembly Language concepts through a series of set puzzles and projects._


## Instruction Set

Based off of the Little Man Computer IS, but has a few extra commands to interface with "Peripherals"
